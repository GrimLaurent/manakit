## Motivation

There are hundreds of interface frameworks. 

Why a new one? 

We realized that many frameworks wanted to do everything and this was mainly based on the standards imposed by Material Design. Bored with the lack of originality and the complexity of some and the financial cost of others, we decided to create our own open source framework. Starting from an idea in the air, we want to make this project a reality in order to make a free, open source, simple and maintainable interface framework over time. We are inspired by the MD frameworks and the Swift UI architecture in order to offer a development alternative.

[Join us](https://discord.gg/ZEqWHHpmM4) and let's create an awesome framework together.
