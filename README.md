## Introduction

Manakit is a user interface component library for web applications. It is based on the Javascript language via the React.js framework. It has a clean and modern syntax, offers full customization and native support for recent browsers.

Although inspired by Material Design, Vuetify and many other interface libraries, Manakit is not itself a library derived from Material Design. As a complete and independent library, Manakit brings together essential components such as theme management, grids (12 columns) and normalized CSS standards. Manakit embraces the modules in order to limit the imports and the duplication of code that they imply.
