In Manakit, the `App` component and the **app** prop on components like `NavigationDrawer`, `AppBar`, `Footer` and more, help bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around `<Main>` component. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without the hassle of managing your layout sizing. The `App` component is **REQUIRED** for all applications. This is the mount point for many of Manakit's components and functionality and ensures that it propagates the default application variant (**dark/light**) to children components and also ensures proper cross-browser support for certain click events in browsers like Safari. `App` should only be rendered within your application **ONCE**.
